# Bambooing

Welcome to bambooing, a gem to track bamboo time hassle free! This gem is addressed to people who forgets to clock-(in|out) during work hours.

## Usage

If you have docker installed on your machine, please run the following command:
```bash
make create_current_weekdays
```

This will add entries in Bamboo for the current week. These entries will consist of 8 hours per day with 2 breaks of 0-30 minutes, summing a total of 40 weekly hours. Note, it is needed to pass valid values for the configuration.env file (e.g. csrf_token, session_id or employee_id)

## Test

```bash
make test
```

## Development

```bash
make devel
```

This will create an image and run a container to play/develop further features in bambooing. Then, run `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'bambooing'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bambooing
